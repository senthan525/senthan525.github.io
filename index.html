        <h1>Inspirational Message</h1>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúSir we begin our lives as WPPs just trying to find our way like a new born baby seal flopping helplessly in the surf, and with constant pressure and failures many die off and succumb to their weakness and frailties. But some stay the course and become who they want to be and live life on their own terms, not scared and afraid of others and their judgments, never afraid of falling! They laugh at their life‚Äôs losses because they know there are more gains to be had! Worries only waste precious time! They become greatness! But then‚Ä¶they die. and their descendants die and they are forgotten. The earth is exploded by the sun and the sun dies out with a whimper in the vast, cold, dark universe. Not even their memories remain as the last star burns out. No excuses do what you will.‚Äù

            <p>Sir, it is your 30th birthday. Happy Birthday! You have successfully completed 30 trips around the Sun while flying through space on this small, blue planet. In honor of your 30th birthday, we have created this website so we can keep track of all these hashtags. It does not matter much anyways because the Sun will one day burn everything up, but at least there will be a record of our friendship as it begins to slowly drift apart. Starting from good friends, to then aquaintenances, and then to finally just penpals. No excuses, do what you will.</p>
            <p>Your pen pal,</p>
            <p>Raj Mafaking Morgan</p>
